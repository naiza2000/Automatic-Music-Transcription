# Automatic-Music-Transcription

##  TASK 1 : Getting started ##
### Reading resources ###
1. Python: <br/> 
    a. [Python For Everybody](http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf) <br/>
    b. [Python Tutorial](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial) <br/>
    c. Hackerrank : [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) <br/>
    d. [Numpy Basics](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) <br/>
2. Music Representation: <br/>
    a. [Chapter 1: Fundamentals of music processing by Meinard Müller](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16D8ahAWFJ-UpnjTzyLL1BP7C5GdSz7cY/view?usp=sharing) <br/>
    You can find the summary of the chapter in the subdirectory `Automatic-Music-Transcription/Task 1` <br/>

### GitHub for work ###
Fork the repository, clone it on your local pc, and do the assignments and push all changes back to your forked repo before the deadline. <br/>
Those who are not familiar with GitHub can use following resources to understand the working. <br/>
1. [Learn Git in 10 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) <br/>
2. [Forking the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### Assignment 1 ###
Deadling for submission is 23:59 PM on 4 June 2021. Make changes in the notebook `Music_Representations.ipynb` itself and push the modified notebook to your **forked** repo.
<br/>
You can do the assignment either in the [Google Colab](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/getting-started-with-google-colab-notebooks-117e2bb0c220) or in the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 

## TASK 2 : Fourier Transform
### Learning resources ###
1. [Sound analysis using Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-audio-data-fourier-transform-fft-spectrogram-and-speech-recognition-a4072d228520) <br/>
2. [Fast Fourier Transform](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/elegant-scipy/9781491922927/ch04.html) <br/>
3. [Chapter 2: Fundamentals of music processing by Meinard Müller](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16D8ahAWFJ-UpnjTzyLL1BP7C5GdSz7cY/view?usp=sharing) <br/>
4. [Video on audio preprocessing using Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf&index=11) <br/>
5. [But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) <br/>

Everyone is supposed to go through this part very carefully since it is important for you to understand the audio preprocessing to successfully train the model. Deadline for this task is 23:59 PM on 11 June 2021. </br>
Also, start reading this [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfTdByvWplpbZPdWDoiLVWeD5THJ32Oc/view?usp=sharing) side by side to have a better idea of exactly how and what to learn.
